### 1. Download and Install

#### Windows
1. Download `file-sharing-app.exe` from the [releases page](../../releases)
2. Run the executable - no installation required
3. Windows may show a security warning - click "More info" then "Run anyway"

#### macOS
1. Download `file-sharing-app-darwin` from the [releases page](../../releases)
2. Open Terminal and make it executable: `chmod +x file-sharing-app-darwin`
3. Run: `./file-sharing-app-darwin`
4. If macOS blocks it, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click "Open Anyway"

#### Linux
1. Download `file-sharing-app-linux` from the [releases page](../../releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x file-sharing-app-linux`
3. Run: `./file-sharing-app-linux`

### 2. Set Up AWS Infrastructure

Before using the app, you need to deploy AWS infrastructure:

1. **Install AWS CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Windows (using PowerShell)
   msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
   
   # macOS
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
   
   # Linux
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI** with your credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region (e.g., `us-east-1`), and output format (`json`).

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd file-sharing-app
   
   # Generate parameters and deploy
   ./infrastructure/scripts/generate-params.sh
   ./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Save the Output**: After deployment, save the displayed AWS credentials and S3 bucket name - you'll need these for the app.

### 3. Configure the Application

1. Launch the File Sharing App
2. Click the "Settings" button
3. Enter your AWS configuration:
   - **AWS Region**: The region where you deployed (e.g., `us-east-1`)
   - **S3 Bucket Name**: From the deployment output
   - **AWS Access Key ID**: From the deployment output
   - **AWS Secret Access Key**: From the deployment output
4. Click "Save" - credentials are stored securely in your OS keychain

### 4. Start Sharing Files

1. Click "Upload File" or drag a file onto the upload area
2. Select expiration time (1 hour to 1 month)
3. Click "Upload" and wait for completion
4. Click "Share" next to your uploaded file
5. Add recipient email addresses and an optional message
6. Copy the generated sharing link and send it to recipients

## User Guide

### Uploading Files

2. **Add Recipients**: Enter email addresses (one per line or comma-separated)
3. **Custom Message**: Add an optional message for recipients
4. **Generate Link**: Click "Generate Share Link"
5. **Copy Link**: Copy the secure presigned URL and send to recipients
6. **Link Expiration**: Share links expire based on your file's expiration setting

### Managing Files

- **View Files**: All your uploaded files appear in the main list
- **File Details**: Click on a file to see upload date, expiration, and sharing history
- **Delete Files**: Click "Delete" to remove files from S3 and your local list
- **Offline Access**: View your file history even when offline
- **Status Tracking**: See file status (uploading, active, expired, error)

### Settings Configuration

Access settings via the "Settings" button:

- **AWS Region**: AWS region for your S3 bucket (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- **S3 Bucket Name**: Your unique S3 bucket name from infrastructure deployment
- **AWS Credentials**: Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (stored securely)
- **Default Expiration**: Default expiration time for new uploads
- **Theme**: Light or dark UI theme (if available)

## AWS Credential Configuration

The application supports multiple methods for AWS credential configuration:

### Method 1: Application Settings (Recommended)
1. Open the app and click "Settings"
2. Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
3. Credentials are stored securely in your OS keychain:
   - **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
   - **macOS**: Keychain Access
   - **Linux**: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet)

### Method 2: Environment Variables
Set these environment variables before launching the app:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Method 3: AWS Credentials File
Create `~/.aws/credentials` file:
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your-access-key-id
aws_secret_access_key = your-secret-access-key
```

And `~/.aws/config` file:
```ini
[default]
region = us-east-1
```

### Method 4: IAM Roles (EC2/ECS)
If running on AWS infrastructure, the app can use IAM roles automatically.
